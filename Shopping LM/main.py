#Write a short program that allows a user to create a shopping list by adding and removing items from the list. You will want to connect this to functions that handle adding and removing items from the list. And print the list after each change.

#Since you don't know loops and conditionals yet use the code below to have your code run more than once.

                                  Enter 3 to leave the list:\n""")
