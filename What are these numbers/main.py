#Write a program that takes in a number from the user and then format that number as:

#an integer with the comma to separate the thousands
#a float with 4 decimal places
#a percentage
#and then a dollar amount

#you can have more than one user input and ask for different numbers

#The output needs to properly incorporate the number into a sentence (for each of the outputs) 

#num,000 = input("Give me a number: ")
#num4. = input("Give me a number: ")
#num% = input("Give me another: ")
#num$ = input("Don't be shy give me another: ")

#print("")
