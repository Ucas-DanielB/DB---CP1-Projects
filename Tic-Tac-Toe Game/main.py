#Create a game that allows a user to play tic-tac-toe. 

#The board needs to be made out of a list of lists (3 lists, one for each row)

#The program needs to use a nested for loop to print the board after each turn

#The program needs to use random to have a computer play for O (your user will be X)

#Make sure user instructions are clear on how to play and make sure you check for a winner after each turn (This should be a function with conditionals for the different win conditions).
